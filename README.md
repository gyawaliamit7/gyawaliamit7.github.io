I am a Software Engineer with a passion for open source. I specialize in Java, Spring, and Vertx. On the front end, I work with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Material. I love learning new things and sharing knowledge through blogs and open-source projects. I'm also passionate about collaborating with early-stage startups that share my values, leveraging my knowledge and experience to support and guide them.
