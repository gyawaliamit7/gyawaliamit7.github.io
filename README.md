# Hello  World !!

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for open source. I specialize in Java, Spring, and Vert.x. On the front end, I work with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Material. I love learning new things and sharing knowledge through blogs and open-source projects. I'm also passionate about collaborating with early-stage startups that share my values, leveraging my knowledge and experience to support and guide them.

In my free time, you can often find me exploring the latest tech trends, experimenting with new programming languages, or enjoying a good cup of tea while brainstorming innovative ideas for the future.
